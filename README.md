# Smart Trolley System Using RFID 

## Overview
The Smart Trolley System utilizes RFID technology to enhance the shopping experience in retail environments. This system includes a smart shopping trolley equipped with an RFID reader. Each product in the store is tagged with an RFID chip containing information about the item, including its price. As customers place products into the trolley or remove them, the system automatically updates the total price, providing a seamless and efficient checkout process.

## Features
- **Automatic Price Calculation:** The trolley calculates the total price in real-time as items are added or removed, eliminating the need for manual scanning at checkout counters.
- **Instant Item Identification:** RFID tags allow for quick identification and inventory management, improving operational efficiency.
- **Enhanced Shopping Experience:** Customers enjoy a more streamlined and interactive shopping experience, reducing time spent at checkout.

## Components
- **RFID Reader:** Installed on the trolley to detect RFID tags on products.
- **RFID Tags:** Attached to each product in the store, carrying information such as price and product ID.
- **Display Screen:** A screen on the trolley shows the current list of items and the total price.
- **Microcontroller:** Controls the RFID reader and updates the display screen accordingly.
- **Power Supply:** Batteries or a rechargeable power system to power the trolley's electronic components.
- **Software:** Manages data collection from the RFID reader, processes item additions and deletions, and updates the total cost dynamically.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Equip Products with RFID Tags:** Attach RFID tags to all products, each programmed with the item's unique ID and price information.
2. **Install RFID Readers on Trolleys:** Integrate RFID readers into each trolley along with the display screen and microcontroller.
3. **Software Configuration:** Program the software to read the RFID data, calculate the total price of items in the trolley, and display this information to the customer.
4. **Test the System:** Conduct thorough testing to ensure accuracy in product detection and price calculation.
5. **Deploy:** Roll out the equipped trolleys and tagged products in the retail environment.

## Operation
- **Shopping:** Customers collect products and place them into their trolley. The RFID reader detects each product's tag, and the system updates the list of items and the total price on the display screen in real time.
- **Removing Items:** If a customer decides to remove an item, the system automatically detects the removal and subtracts the itemâ€™s price from the total.
- **Checkout:** Upon completion of shopping, the customer proceeds to a checkout point where the total amount is verified, and payment is processed. This can also be integrated with an automated payment system for an even faster checkout process.

This Smart Trolley System with RFID technology represents a significant improvement in retail shopping, combining technology with convenience to enhance the customer experience and streamline store operations.
